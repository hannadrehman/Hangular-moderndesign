# Hangular-moderndesign

##Synopsis

Hangular-Modern Design is component Framework for front end development based on angularjs 1.5.
the application logic has shifted from server side to client side. so new we write all the application logic in javascript and html.it is very important to build a pattern of development that would help the developer write and develop neat and reusable code.modern web development has introduced the concept of web components , react and angular are to major javascript libraries that provide a good way of defining and writting components. the major problem with this approach is that there is alot of javascript to be included in our html pages. and to structure the project is even more difficult and problamatic. so here i have developed a Framework that takes care of all these moderen web development problems. this framework is build with Nodej,Gulpjs and angularJs. this framework bundles all the javascript,html,css and provides a neat and tidy code for production.

##Motivation

i have been a strugling Ux/UI engineer for a while now. and to create a folder structure for my project is the most challanging task ever. organisation of the code is very important when working with the team. if you are the project creater it is faily easy for you to dive into the code structure but for others it is difficult. so it is important to make a structure that makes development as well as organisation of code easy. i wanted to make a project which would make organising independent modules easy. thats is why i started on this project.

##Installation

You need to install NodeJs for this project to run successfully. 
this project uses. NODEJS,GULPJS as the build tools or task runner.if you dont have node installed please intall node first.
WINDOWS:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

LINUX:
```
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 68576280
sudo apt-add-repository "deb https://deb.nodesource.com/node_5.x $(lsb_release -sc) main"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```
I have included all the node packages used in this project even then if you want to download them manually please install node npm on your system and open package.json file to look for all the project dependencies required. you can use npm to download them for your system.

once the node and npm(if required) is installed you need to install gulp globally.
